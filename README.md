As a college student, I often struggle with knowing what to make before my food goes bad. I don't have time everyday to make it to the store to buy more so I need recipes of what I can make quickly. 
When a user makes a meal, they can easily use Pantry.io to see what they can make with the food they have.

When I user signs up, they set what is in there pantry, also, after shopping, they can add what groceries they purchased whenever they'd like as well. Next, when they want to make a meal, they can see what foods they can make based on what items they have in their pantry!

HTML assignment:
Users can also benefit from checking out my simon game on m website: [https//:simon.pantryplusplus.click](https://simon.pantryplusplus.click/)
While makeing that game I learned a lot about how html is layed out and how to make classes, etc. Everything works better when you carefully plan out how you want things to look. SVG is a little confusing but with some examples you can do some really really cool things. I want to look more into that!

CSS assignment:
While doing the CSS and Bootstrap assignment, I learned just how cool bootstrap is! with just a few lines of code you can make things look really nice. Looking/Studying the example code really helped as well. I used mostly the same layouts, colors, and elements it used. I also realized just how important it is to have a good main.css and pick colors that work together. I used colors at first that I thought would like nice and it was terrible. I then used the colors that was in the code example and it looked so much more clean and professional. I am very excited to get started on mh startup site!
