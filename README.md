Simon React assignment:
- Getting react set up takes a lot of work but has a lot of power
- I kinda wish we wouldve started with react so the transition would be a lot easier. 
- React lets you have a lot of power in your javascript files and keep your html files reather empty.
- React gives your applications a lot of reactability to the user.
