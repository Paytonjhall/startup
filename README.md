## Things I learned from the HTML and CSS
- Its difficult to get colors working just right. Getting the right colors will take time and practice
- Having a clean html page is very important or you will quickly get lost in the code
- CSS is very powerful and can do a lot of things. Its very important to keep that clean as well.
- I really like designing with CSS. It is very easy and fast to see big changes. I'm planning on making my own little profile website once I'm done with this class.
- ./deployFiles.sh  -k ../../pantrykey.pem -h pantryplusplus.click -s startup
- That is the script to run form the startup directory. It will deploy the files to the server.
