# Bank Buddy
Bank Buddy is a simple web program that allows users to easily budget, track, and manage their finances.
There are a million and a half budgeting apps, but bank buddy allows you to easily track income and expenses for just one person, a small family, or even a large corporation.
When a user makes a bank buddy account, they will be the only person in their bank. But they can easily add others to their bank.
## How to use
Each user can be a part of 10 banks. 
A user could have a bank with their spouse to track expenses. A bank for each child to monitor their spending, and possibly even more for work related purposes.
Each bank has an ID and secret, the ID is needed to add money and lower members (like children) while the secret is needed to add members and remove money. The secret requires many steps to attain.
## Why use bank buddy?
Bank buddy has the ability to only allow money going out if each member of the bank allows it. This can stop children from making irrational purchases, require unanimity amongst bank members, and prevent fraud.
Bank buddy will have a simple interface since its only job is to protect and monitor.
